A private portfolio consisting of school and personal projects

Project-1-N3ptune is a python lexer that takes an input string and breaks it into tokens, returning the Token type, Token name, and Token line number. Files I made are fsm.py, lexer.py, and test_fsm. I was given a base for token.py, and just filled out the rest of the classes. I was given the test_lexer.py files.
