A private portfolio consisting of school and personal projects

Project-1-N3ptune is a python lexer that takes an input string and breaks it into tokens, returning the Token type, Token name, and Token line number. Files I made are fsm.py, lexer.py, and test_fsm. I was given a base for token.py, and just filled out the rest of the classes. I was given the test_lexer.py files.

Webcrawler is a program that takes in a link, and either strips the link to the domain, and then writes a list of all of the links connected to that domain with the robots.txt file, and a count of how many unique links there are affiliated with that domain, or pulls off and writes tables found on the link, or pulls off, applies a filter to, and then writes images off of the link.

Webscraper is a very basic webscraping program to pull grouped data off of a website and write it to an exported excel table.

DS and A is a group of various data structure classes I wrote, as well as a couple of sorting algorithms, in C++.

Wedding Project has a program that I used to grab addresses off of an I Need Your Address link, and gives mailable addresses. The other program was used to quickly write and format thank you notes that can be personalized by person, gift, adjectives, and a special note.
